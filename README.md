# Glitch Utopia

Wrecking the internet has never been so easy: glitch up the web for an anarchist's utopia.

## Introduction

The web was meant to be an utopia for everyone. The vast space and tools supposedly enable anyone to create, build and present for themselves with infinite freedom. Sadly, this is not what have happened. As personal blogs decline and social media giants rise, personal space has become a public resource for ad revenue and recommendation algorithms. The technology used to build the web has also evolved to cater the need of businesses instead of individuals. The web as we know it has begin a path of no return towards centralization rather than decentralization.

This project is a small step in reverse. The code listed here attack the painstakingly standard web layouts in all mainstream website and bring the web into its natural state of chaos and anarchy, a true digital utopia for everyone.
